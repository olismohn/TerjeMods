# TerjeMods

This repository contains the complete and original source code of the TerjeMods project — a collection of gameplay modifications created for the DayZ platform. The purpose of this publication is to provide the DayZ community with open access to the internal implementation of the modifications, to support learning, creativity, and further non-commercial development within the ecosystem of the game.

## Community Ownership and Freedom of Use

TerjeMods are released for the benefit of the entire DayZ community. The code, configurations, and related materials are intended to be freely available for study, modification, and use by players, server owners, and developers. Everyone is welcome to explore how the modifications work, adapt them to their own projects, create derivative works, or integrate parts of the code into other non-commercial community initiatives.

The project is distributed with the understanding that DayZ is driven by its community, and these modifications exist thanks to the passion and support of that community. This repository is provided as a contribution to that shared environment.

Use of this source code is permitted for personal and non-commercial purposes only.
Any form of commercial exploitation is strictly prohibited. 

This includes, but is not limited to:
- selling the modifications or any part of the code,
- using the code in paid products or services,
- monetizing servers or projects where TerjeMods are a core component,
- generating direct or indirect revenue through advertising or subscriptions to the use of this code.

*Collecting voluntary donations without receiving any benefit is permitted and is not considered a paid service.*
